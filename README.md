## Overview
This was an interesting challenge. And I loved every single line of code of it

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla Js
- Vanilla CSS

### What I learned

The main core of this project is to text your understanding of how to call and use functions and it was very okay for me to use this opportunity to relearn how to manupulate functions


### Continued development

I will take on more of the challenges from frontend to sharpen my coding skills even more. I want to be a superStar in this choosen field.
